    "She tends to care a lot for the Sensei, making sure they don't eat too many unhealthy kinds of food and asking for them to call her if they ever need a meal prepared. Some characters joke that she makes a great housewife as she's skilled at selecting and haggling over ingredients as well as being able to cook well.",
    "Best wife, yes, would marry. The kind of wife I want, very domestic and homey. Very dependable which is super hot!",

    "A seemingly calm and laid-back girl who doesn't seem to show much concern on most occasions. At best, she would only mention what's wrong with the situation because most of the time, the situation goes wrong before she can do anything about it. However, behind those closed eyes of hers lies a destructive personality that lays hidden until Ichika's patience breaks. When that happens, Ichika's destructiveness can possibly even parallel Tsurugi's. She is not one to be underestimated.",
    "She's really pretty, can be bratty and needy which is nice, a fellow Bisaya. She'd be a nice girlfriend and even wife, because she's very patient, and knows how to take care of her juniors. Very dependable which is super hot.",
    "yes"

    "Although shown to seem rather cold and distant on the outside, Hina is shown to be a very relaxed and soft person when she's allowed to express herself, despite her title as of the head of the Prefect Team. She is always busy with work and considers many of her tasks as bothersome, if not understandably, stressfully exhausting. It is later revealed in Treaty of Eden that should the Treaty be signed, she wishes to retire as she feels exhausted by everything involving Gehenna. When Sensei found her in Chapter 3 after things turned dire, she easily broke down, believed she was not as strong as Hoshino as she could not emotionally process extreme tragedy very well while continuing to live a normal life, causing her to take any opportunities to be praised, comforted and feel like a child spoiled by Sensei to keep going.",
    "Hinature is best waifu, she's beautiful, she's the best, the cutest, the most hardworking, the most reliable, and the most dependable girl in Kivotos. She must be given all the praise and love, all the hugs too, she needs friends outside of her Disciplinary Committee.",
    "yes"
